Personal Portfolio — Under Development

Welcome to my **Personal Portfolio Website**, built to showcase my projects, skills, and experiences as a developer.  
This project is currently **in progress**, and I’ll be adding more sections, designs, and features very soon! 🚀  


 About the Project
This portfolio will serve as my **digital resume and creative space**, built to highlight:
- My best **projects** (web apps, systems, and open-source work n many more)
- My **skills** in languages and frameworks like Python, Django, Flask, JavaScript, and more
- My journey as a **developer and student**
- A way for people to **connect** and collaborate with me

It’s still evolving — I’m continuously working on design improvements, responsiveness, animations, and backend integration.


Tech Stack (So Far)
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3 / Tailwind / Bootstrap** (TBD)
- **JavaScript**
- **Git & GitHub for version control**


## 🚧 Current Status

- 🕐 UI & layout under design  
- 🔜 Planning to host live soon on GitHub Pages or Render  


 💡 Planned Features
- 📂 Projects showcase with live previews

## 🎨 Design Goal
A **modern**, **clean**, and **interactive** interface that reflects my personality as a developer — simple but powerful.  
I want it to feel professional, welcoming, and techy, with smooth visuals and a personal touch 💫
